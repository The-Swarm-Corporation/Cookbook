    "# Comprehensive Walkthrough: Managing Multiple Agent Outputs with SpreadSheetSwarm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to manage and analyze outputs from multiple agents using the `SpreadSheetSwarm` architecture. \n",
    "When dealing with multiple agents, each producing different outputs, it can become challenging to manage and analyze these results efficiently. \n",
    "The `SpreadSheetSwarm` helps solve this problem by organizing the outputs into a spreadsheet format, making it easier to compare, analyze, \n",
    "and optimize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the challenges of managing multiple agent outputs.\n",
    "- Learn how to create custom agents for different tasks.\n",
    "- Use `SpreadSheetSwarm` to organize and analyze agent outputs in a spreadsheet.\n",
    "- Explore how this approach simplifies the analysis and optimization of outputs.\n",
